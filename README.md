## Installing, Building and Running

To build and run the app on mobile devices, you must first install [Unity](https://unity.com/download), including its [AR Framework](https://unity.com/unity/features/arfoundation). From this point on, the steps for building and running differ depending on platform.

### Android

To build and run on Android devices, first ensure you have the latest version of Android installed.

Then, connect your device to your computer using a wired or wireless connection. You will need to enable developer mode on your Android device. The specific method to achieve this is device dependent, so please consult the relevant documentation for your device.

Once your device is connected and in developer mode, allow debugging on your device and open the folder {repo-root}/CENSIS-AR-App/CENSIS-AR-App/ in the Unity Editor. Open the build and run menu, select 'Sample Scene', select your device, and click build and run.
