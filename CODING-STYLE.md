# Coding Style

## C\#

C\# style guide available [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions).

The pipeline enforces [CSharpier](https://csharpier.com/) linting which should be followed at all times.

For files/scripts that relate strongly to a specific external package or API, their code style has been used as much as possible. For example, the [Mapbox Unity SDK](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-unity-sdk/blob/develop/CODING-STYLE.md) style has been used in map related files e.g. [MapManager.cs](CENSIS-AR-App/Assets/Scripts/CENSIS/Runtime/MapManager.cs).

## Python

Python code should follow the standard [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guide.

## JSON

Make sure all JSON confirms to highly standardised JSON linting practices. This example is from [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml).
